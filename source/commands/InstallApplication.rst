Unified Logging
---------------

- Download operations are performed by **storedownloadd**. You may be able to see information about what it is doing via:
    - **Subsystem:** com.apple.commerce (also contains storeassetd)
    - **Category:** CKLegacy

  These lines may be logged::

   ISStoreURLOperation: Starting URL operation with url=https://hostname/package.pkg / bagKey=(null)
   -[ISStoreURLOperation _runURLOperation]: _addStandardQueryParametersForURL: https://hostname/package.pkg
   <HashedDownloadProvider: 0x7fd792a1f110>: Opening file /var/folders/zz/random/C/com.apple.appstore/0/package.pkg returning file descriptor 4 (0 streamed)
   sending status (Title of software package): 0.000000% (0.000000)
   sending status (Title of software package): 0.806452% (8.000000)
   ... etc ... up to 1.000000%


- Initial command processing and manifest fetch is performed by **mdmclient**, which may log the following lines::

    Processing server request: InstallApplication  for: <Device>
    Scheduled InstallApplication from: https://hostname/manifest.plist

Caveats (10.12)
---------------

- It is impossible to know whether the installation succeeded or failed.
- If storedownloadd fails, it blocks all further application installs `OpenRADAR <https://openradar.appspot.com/26517261>`_. courtesy of bruienne.
  This can happen due to:
    - malformed manifest.plist
    - incorrect md5 hash(es)
    - TLS trust fails fetching manifest



Simultaneous Downloads
----------------------

Groob writes:

An ``InstallApplication`` command consists of two parts. A manifest plist and a signed pkg that the manifest points to.
Once the MDM server queues an ``InstallApplication``, the mdmclient process will defer the download to storedownloadd which does the following:

#. Sends "Acknowledged" or "NotNow" to the MDM server.
#. Uses HTTP GET request to fetch the manifest.
#. Caches the manifest locally. future requests skip step 1 and use the local cache.
   (I haven't done any investigation into how the cache is invalidated, but that's not important here.

What's important is that there are two initial requests for a single InstallApplication command.
- uses HTTP GET request to download the .pkg
- installs the pkg.
We can observe this action in the logs::

The Problem:

Queueing one ``InstallApplication`` command before the previous one completes will most likely cause only one install to actually succeed.
Here's what I'm seeing in the logs::

    # acknowledged two scheduled IA commands
    connected udid=4A7A3EC2-6755-4113-A5AF-AC10574D953A type=InstallApplication, status=Acknowledged

    # and done. package-B.pkg is never downloaded.

The storedownloadd is scheduled to download two or more applications, but it ends up losing track of things and only downloads one.
This problem doesn't happen if both installs are being repeated and the plist is not being downloaded.
The problem also doesn't happen if the ``InstallApplication`` commands are spaced out such that the first install is completed before the second one starts.

OS Specific Notes
-----------------

x.x.x - 10.12.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A malformed manifest causes storedownloadd not to process any further **InstallApplication** commands until reboot.

10.12.0 - 10.12.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **InstallApplication** will not work before you send a response to ``AwaitDeviceConfiguration``.

10.11.x
^^^^^^^

- **InstallApplication** only works if there is a currently logged in user session.
